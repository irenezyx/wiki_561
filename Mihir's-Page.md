## What is an activity diagram?
<p>The Unified Modeling Language includes several subsets of diagrams, including structure diagrams, interaction diagrams, and behavior diagrams. Activity diagrams, along with use case and state machine diagrams, are considered behavior diagrams because they describe what must happen in the system being modeled.</p>

## Basic components of an activity diagram

* Action: A step in the activity wherein the users or software perform a given task. In Lucidchart, actions are symbolized with round-edged rectangles.

* Decision node: A conditional branch in the flow that is represented by a diamond. It includes a single input and two or more outputs.

* Control flows: Another name for the connectors that show the flow between steps in the diagram.

* Start node: Symbolizes the beginning of the activity. The start node is represented by a black circle.

* End node: Represents the final step in the activity. The end node is represented by an outlined black circle.

## Activity diagram examples
<p>Activity diagrams map out process flows in a way that's easy to understand. Consider the two examples below when it comes to creating UML activity diagrams.</p>
