## Basic components of an activity diagram

* Action: A step in the activity wherein the users or software perform a given task. In Lucidchart, actions are symbolized with round-edged rectangles.

* Decision node: A conditional branch in the flow that is represented by a diamond. It includes a single input and two or more outputs.

* Control flows: Another name for the connectors that show the flow between steps in the diagram.

* Start node: Symbolizes the beginning of the activity. The start node is represented by a black circle.

* End node: Represents the final step in the activity. The end node is represented by an outlined black circle.
