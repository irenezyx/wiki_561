# Vesica Piscis

This is basically when two circles intersect and have the same radius. Most simple minded people would refer to it as a **Venn Diagram**.
## Want to know some funny alternatives names for **Vescia Piscis**?
Well here you are:
* In _Latin_, it means "bladder of fish
* Apparently [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesica_piscis) says that it resembles a "conjoined dual air bladder." Something you can find in fish I guess?
* In Italian this shape is referred to as _mandoria_, which means "almond."

### I couldn't get a Venn Diagram to work in Dia so here is a Circle.
