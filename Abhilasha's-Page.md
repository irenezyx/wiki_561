# **Geometric Shapes**
### Geometric Shapes can be defined as an area closed by a boundary which is formed by combining the specific amount of points, lines and curves. Different type of geometrical shapes are triangle, square, rectangle, circle etc. There are a lot of practical uses of geometry in our day to day life. Even the very basic concept of an area can be a huge factor that will affect your daily task. Geometry is also used by professionals to do their job properly. An application like computer imaging is something that is used nowadays for creating animations, video games, designing, and stuff like that, are created using geometric concepts. Also, geometry is used in mapping. Mapping is an essential element in professions such as surveying, navigation, and astronomy. From sketching to calculating distances, they use geometry to accomplish their job. In addition, professions such as medicine benefit from geometric imaging. Technologies such as CT scans and MRIs are used both for diagnosis and surgical aids. Such methods enable doctors to do their job better, safer, and simpler. This is how geometry has a huge impact on each individuals life.

# **Type of Geometric Shapes:**

## 1. Triangle
### Triangle comprises three connected line segments. The angles of the triangle can be of distinct measurements. They 
arenâ€™t always the right angles. Triangles are named, depending upon the type of angles which is found within the triangle itself.
## **Types of Triangle:**
## 1. **Acute Angled Triangle** 
###      This type of triangle has all angles less than 90 degrees.
##    2. **Obtuse Angled Triangle**
###      This type of triangle has any one of the angles greater than 90 degrees.
##    3. **Right Angled Triangle**
###      This type of triangle has one the angle exactly equal to 90 degrees.
##    4. **Equiangular Triangle**
###      This type of triangle has all angles equal to 60 degrees.

## 2. Square
###   A square is a four-sided figure which is created by connecting 4 line segments. The line segments in the square are 
      all of the equal lengths and they come together to form 4 right angles.

## 3. Rectangle
###   Similar to a square, a rectangle is also created by connecting four line segments. However, the only difference 
      between a square and a rectangle is that in a rectangle, there are two line segments which are longer than the other 
      two line segments.So, in geometry, a rectangle is also described as an elongated square. Also, in a rectangle, the 
      four corners come together to form four right angles.

## 4. Circle
###   On the other hand, a circle which is another shape of geometry has no straight lines. It is rather a combination of 
      curves that are all connected. In a circle, there are no angles to be found.

## 5. Parallelogram
###   A parallelogram is another in the geometric shapes in which the opposite side of the shape are parallel.
