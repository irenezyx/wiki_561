## List of Theme Parks
- [Universal Studios Florida™](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/theme-parks/universal-studios-florida/index.html#subnav-a)
  - Hang on tight. Your heroes are about to burst through the screen and yank you into the story. You’re the star here and you’ll disappear into one jaw-dropping adventure after another. Dodge evil villains. Defend the earth. Face a fire-breathing dragon. Wander into animated worlds where characters you love are suddenly right beside you. Go beyond the screen, behind the scenes and jump into the action of your favorite films at the world’s premier movie and TV based theme park. 
- [Universal's Islands of Adventure™](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/theme-parks/islands-of-adventure/index.html)
  - Prepare for a place where super heroes, beasts, and magical creatures stand before you. You're entering lands where everything is real. Explore a secret school of witchcraft and wizardry. Fly high above the city streets with a famous web slinger. Hide from hungry dinosaurs and hope you're not their next meal. And you can face the most colossal ape ever to walk the earth. Let the adventures begin.
- [Universal's Volcano Bay™](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/theme-parks/volcano-bay/index.html)
  - At this water theme park, thrills and relaxation flow in perfect harmony. And right now, the palm trees are still swaying, the Florida sun is shining and the crowds are lighter. It’s the perfect place to step back into summer. Here, the TapuTapu™ wearable lets you hold your place in the ride lines and reveal wondrous surprises with just a wave of your wrist. *During the cooler months, the water here is still delightfully warm to 85°.*
- [Universal CityWalk™](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/theme-parks/citywalk/index.html)
  - This is where it all comes together. This is where unforgettable family fun meets restaurants that don't just make you say "Yum," but "Wow." The one place where the dining tastes of every member of the family and entertainment everyone can enjoy all intersect. It's everything you're looking for. And anything but ordinary. Universal CityWalk, The Epicenter of Awesome. *Free self-parking after 6 pm for all guests.* (Not valid during Halloween Horror Nights™.
